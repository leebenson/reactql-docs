<h2 id="what">What is ReactQL?</h2>

ReactQL is a CLI tool for deploying a React + GraphQL starter kit on Mac, Windows and Linux.

It combines best-of-breed choices for UI, GraphQL data fetching, CSS and code bundling, handles server-side rendering (SSR) properly, and is fast and extensible. You can choose Javascript or Typescript flavours.

If you want to skip the tedious set-up code in your next front-end project, try ReactQL.
